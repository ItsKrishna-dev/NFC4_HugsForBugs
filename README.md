 ## Document Summarizer with Contextual Q&A

### Problem Statement:

Legal professionals, researchers, and executives frequently deal with extensive documents like contracts, research papers, project reports, or policy briefs. Reading and understanding such documents consumes significant time, and locating key information (like deadlines, obligations, or risks) often requires manual scanning. 

Even tools that summarize documents fail to retain the context or support follow-up questions. An intelligent AI assistant that not only summarizes but also answers specific queries contextually from within the document can revolutionize document handling in legal, academic, and corporate sectors.

This project aims to create a **web-based AI tool** that enables:
- 📄 Document upload
- 🧠 Automatic summarization
- 💬 Contextual Q&A
- 🔍 Interactive exploration with semantic accuracy
